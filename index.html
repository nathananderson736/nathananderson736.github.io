                            <h2>About My Portfolio</h2>
							<p>Design was one of the key aspects in mind for my portfolio. A web portfolio provided me with an awesome opportunity to create my own visual identity from the sources that inspire me, but with such vast access to inspiration, came responsibility/balance. I wanted to achieve a style I was going to love, but I also wanted to show my care for the smaller details like, balance, consistency, readability, things that add up in a big way towards creating trust.</p>
							
							<h3>Font Choice</h3> 
							<p>I tend to get an energetic vibe from listening to rock a lot with its punchiness. Creating a visual identity was one of my goals for my portfolio, so I knew I wanted that energetic vibe to be visually part of my design. Taking away the excess that experimenting gave me, it boiled down to using a font with a slight imperfect appearance. I found it was the most simple and effective way to express energy and character without forgetting my target audience.</p>
							<h3>Tools</h3>

								<li>Sass/CSS3</li>

                            <h2>Advanced Client-Side Project - Sticky Notes Application</h2>

							</div>
							<h3>Goal</h3>
                            <p>For our advanced client-side project, we needed to research modern web technologies such as, HTML5/CSS3 as well as geolocation api or local storage, to create a mobile first optimized website that would showcase modern web technologies. I saw local storage as a chance to fulfil my desire to create something interactive and useful, similar to an app or a site that relies on a database. Memo/note apps already exist, Google Keep being my favourite, but it wasn't going to stop me from making my own one. I liked the idea of creating my own UI, even more when it has purpose and integrates with our lives.</p>
							<h3>Design</h3>
							<p>It wasn't my desire to straight copy sites like Google Keep or Evernote for my notes website. For inspiration I was drawn more towards Google Keeps interface. For anyone who wanted to use my site, including myself, I wanted the interface to be minimal, avoiding scattered UI elements that would detract from the experience of feeling like you're using your own personal board.</p>

							</div>
							<h3>Goal</h3>
                            <p>Our end of year client project required us to search for an actual client to create a website for. We could take on the client's requirements, so long as they met our assessment requirements. After phoning around seeking any small cinema as my client, I got not a cinema, but the manager of one who needed a personal site made. Kate Larkindale, manager at the time of Penthouse Cinema in Wellington, is currently and has been for some time, a writer and film reviewer. Kate needed a personal site as an improvement over her blog, which she uses for blog posts and to display her books.</p>

                            <h3>My Assessment Requirements</h3>
                            <ul class = "list">
								<li>Responsive/Mobile First Design.</li>
								<li>Use PHP and MySQL to interact with a database.</li>
								<Li>Use two of the following three:
									<ul class = "list">
										<li>Search Engine Optimization</li>
										<li>Enhanced for Accessibility</li>
										<li>Use an API</li>
									</ul>
								</li>
							</ul>

                            <h3>Kate's Requirements</h3>
                            <ul class = "list">
								<li>Site design that reflect Kate's style</li>
								<li>Display catalogue of Kate's books with links to online retailers</li>
								<Li>Latest book needed to be highly visible</li>
								<li>Personal account to add, update and delete books displayed</li>
								<li>Bio for those unware of who Kate Larkindale is</li>
